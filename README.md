## Introduction:
This implementation is part of an academic programming assignment during Machine Learning Lecture of Gredient Descent.

## Implementation:
The task is to write a python program to implement batch linear regression using gradient descent using the standard gradient descent calculation.

## Input data:
Input data is expected to be a .csv file with last column as target value. It will be provided through terminal while running the program

## Output:
Expected output is a .csv file with weights and sse value for each example point. It will be created in the same working directory.

## How to Run the program?
Using the following command:

    python3 linearregression.py --data somedata.csv --learningRate somevalue --threshold somevalue
